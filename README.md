location of initial XSD docs for a Management Simulation Schema

Developed as part of a chapter called "Creating effective management simulations: rapidly, responsibly, relevantly!"

The XSD is a starting place to create a format simulations that can created by academics, businesses, and students and then consumed within a management simulation engine capable of reasing the XSD and returing a usable interface that enables the simulations to be tested, played, used in the classroom and evolved to reflect changing circumstances.
